	❤Two childhood friends of each sixteen years, barely adults and yet barely still children, were slowly walking home.❤
    ❤While they may have been childhood friends, it was merely the fact that they had known each other for a while.❤
    ❤Their families weren't especially close, and there was no sort of arrangement to celebrate together. They would soon part ways at the next crossing.❤
